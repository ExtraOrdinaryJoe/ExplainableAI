Corollary:
Operational Model: Model that a Data Scientist builds for their use cases.
Explainability model: Model(like SHAP, LIME) that is used to explain the Operational Model.

There are many Explainability models available in the form of libraries. They usually output the importance of features. This is applicable both
globally(On the complete dataset) and locally(for a particular example in Production).  

However, it is always a big question that which explainability model to pick and how to use its explaination to make an informed decision at the training 
stage to build better Operational Models. 

We propose two scores to evaluate the explainability of the models.
1. Explainability Score of an Operational Model
2. Stability score of an Explainability model


1. Explainability Score(e) of an Operational Model 
After some research, we have zeroed down on four features that we believe drives the explainability. They are:
D:
F:
R:
S:
<More to be added>

To start with we are taking a simple average of all the four scores to derive an explainability score ie: e= (D+F+R+S) / 4

2. Stability Score (s) of an Explainability Model
